# Java-Orbits
A graphical orbit simulator of objects with mass in space, with Newtonian physics.

Recently added an executable jar file. This is yet to be tested on external machines. I was able to successfully get the code from this repository, using github, onto a windows machine that had eclipse, and by fiddling with settings was able to get it to run. Hopefully the jar file will make all of this easier...
