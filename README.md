# Java-Orbits
A graphical orbit simulator of objects with mass in space, with Newtonian physics.

The Orbits folder in this repository is formatted like an eclipse java project, I haven't actually tried pulling it from github
and executing it, so it might not even work, but I will make sure that it is available online once I have a more final version of
this software
